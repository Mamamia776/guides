## Accuracy and Precision

Accuracy and Precision are often used interchangeablly, but mean different things.  Accuracy refers to how close a measured value is to the standard or known value.  For example, if you are trying to measure pi, the accuracy would be determined by how close your measurements are to the known value of pi: 3.141592...  On the other hand, precision is being able to getting close to or the same measurments every time.  Precision then, is completely independent of accuracy.  Using the same example as above, if your measurments constantly get 3.12, then they are precise, but not accurate.  

A good analogy for understanding accuracy and precision is to imagine a basketball player shooting baskets. If the player shoots with accuracy, his aim will always take the ball close to or into the basket. If the player shoots with precision, his aim will always take the ball to the same location which may or may not be close to the basket. A good player will be both accurate and precise by shooting the ball the same way each time and each time making it in the basket.
